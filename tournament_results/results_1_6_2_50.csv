1,20736,50,The administration has also carefully avoided talking about what comes next claiming that it is up to Ukrainians to decide what is in their best interest,NULL,0
1,20736,50,But maintaining that position is becoming more difficult now that Russian President Vladimir Putin has doubled down on the war and made blatant nuclear threats against the West,NULL,0
1,20736,50,Putin has chosen to take significant new risks rather than to back down suggesting that this war will not end through simple Russian capitulation,NULL,0
1,20736,50,Though these risks seem manageable for now the time may come when negotiations are necessary to forestall catastrophe,NULL,0
1,20736,50,At the same time the economic fallout of the war is rapidly growing,NULL,0
1,20736,50,In Ukraine public finances have been ravaged; the country is running out of cash,NULL,0
1,20736,50,In reality the question is not whether negotiations are needed to end the war but when and how they should unfold,NULL,0
1,20736,50,To lay the groundwork for a settlement American policymakers must act to ensure that Ukrainian American and European interests do not diverge,NULL,0

1,20736,50,This does not mean that the West should push Ukraine to concede as some have argued,NULL,0
1,20736,50,But it does suggest that the United States and its partners should provide future aid with an eye to putting Ukraine in the best negotiating position not simply continuing the war,NULL,0
1,20736,50,These goals should be narrow by design rather than trying to retake all of its pre2014 territory or to punish Russian leaders Ukraine should pursue objectives that are less likely to produce dramatic escalation and more likely to result in a durable peace,NULL,0
1,20736,50,Washington should encourage pursuing those objectives and should also make clear to Kyiv at least in private where the limits of American support lie and what the White House perceives as unacceptable escalation risks,NULL,0
1,20736,50,Setting clear expectations now reduces the risk of misperception in Kyiv,NULL,0
1,20736,50,American policymakers must also consider Ukrainian and Russian domestic politics since internal support in both countries will be vital to making any settlement last,NULL,0
1,20736,50,History suggests that a power transition in Moscow is possible but by no means likely or inevitable,NULL,0
1,20736,50,Thus policymakers need to focus on Putin and the small group of elites around him and consider what settlement they might be willing to accept,NULL,0
1,20736,50,But like many other authoritarians before him he can sell a poor result as a win,NULL,0
1,20736,50,This means that it may be possible to find some facesaving deal in which de facto realities such as Russian legal control of Crimea could be recognized and which the Kremlin could portray to the Russian public as genuine concessions by the West,NULL,0
1,20736,50,In Kyiv Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky faces a more open contentious political environment as the divisions of Ukrainian politics begin to reemerge,NULL,0
1,20736,50,Nonetheless he faces a similar dilemma,NULL,0
1,20736,50,After asking so much of Ukrainians the Ukrainian government will find it difficult to compromise in any way that seems to reward the enemy,NULL,0

1,20736,50,In these circumstances a deal in which Ukrainians feel that they have largely triumphed is more likely to succeed,NULL,0
1,20736,50,This makes it all the more important to manage expectations now,NULL,0
1,20736,50,Washington should encourage Kyiv to take a more moderate stance on issues such as Crimea that are likely to figure in a future settlement; to tone down triumphalist talk; and to emphasize the economic rewards that Ukraine stands to receive through international reconstruction aid and European economic integration under a settlement,NULL,0

1,20736,50,And in general policymakers should seek to prioritize practical outcomes over abstract principles,NULL,0
1,20736,50,An independent sovereign Ukraine that can defend itself and integrate economically with Europe for example would be far preferable to a Ukraine with permanent territorial disputes within its borders,NULL,0

1,20736,50,Policymakers should think carefully now about how to use sanctions relief to obtain Russian concessions,NULL,0
1,20736,50,Some sanctions relief for Russia will likely be a prerequisite for a successful peace deal but policymakers should think carefully about which sanctions are worth lifting,NULL,0
1,20736,50,There are three circumstances in which it may make sense for the United States to push for a settlement,NULL,0
1,20736,50,The first is if Ukrainian forces continue to achieve significant success and leadership in Kyiv begins to talk about liberating Crimea,NULL,0
1,20736,50,The second is if Russian forces regain the initiative and retake significant territory particularly if they begin to advance out of the Donbas,NULL,0
1,20736,50,The third is if the two sides become locked in another stalemate with neither able to regain the advantage,NULL,0

1,20736,50,policymakers should consider a settlement when Ukraine is winning when it is losing and when it is doing neither,NULL,0
1,20736,50,And each of the situations outlined above would likely produce wildly different settlements,NULL,0
1,20736,50,But what connects all three is that in each battlefield outcomes point to a relative consensus around which a settlement could be built,NULL,0
1,20736,50,Today the battlefield is still dynamic; both parties think they are going to triumph,NULL,0
1,20736,50,A settlement will become possible only when the outcome on the battlefield becomes more apparent,NULL,0

1,20736,50,They should think through how to effectively leverage sanctions and battlefield gains to put Ukraine in the best position at the negotiating table,NULL,0
1,20736,50,And perhaps most important policymakers in Washington should communicate the results of these discussions to Kyiv and to European capitals in order to avoid potentially dangerous divergences in national interest among Ukraine and its Western partners,NULL,0

1,20736,50,The first is that in this apparently asymmetric contest the smaller party is winning,NULL,0
1,20736,50,A great deal of analysis has been devoted to why Russia has failed to prevail and why Ukraine has not only blunted the invasion but is reversing Russian gains,NULL,0

1,20736,50,It is likely this has been slowed if not reversed by the Ukraine war,NULL,0
1,20736,50,The strategic implications for Asia are promising since perceptions of the potency of offence are generally destabilising because states are anxious about competitors gaining the upper hand by attacking first,NULL,0
