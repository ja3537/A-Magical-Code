1,487633,80,A series of missile strikes hit major Ukrainian cities on Monday morning with the capital Kyiv and cities to the northeast and south being targeted according to regional officials,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Kyivs Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram that part of the capital had been cut off by the strikes which he said had hit critical infrastructure facilities,NULL,0
1,487633,80,There is no water supply in some areas he said,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Meanwhile global wheat prices have started to rise following Russias withdrawal from the Black Sea grain export deal last weekend,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Russia announced Saturday that it was suspending its involvement in the Black Sea Grain Initiative that was brokered in July and which allowed vital agricultural products to be exported from several Ukrainian ports,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The UN and Turkey which help broker the deal said they were working with Russia and Ukraine to help move ships stuck within the maritime corridor being used in the initiative,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The two sides were bogged down in an extended stalemate freeing Western leaders from making difficult choices or thinking too hard about the future of the conflict,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Since the start of the war the Biden administration has effectively maintained a balanced realpolitik approach arming and funding Ukraine yet continuing to make clear that the United States will not engage directly in the conflict,NULL,0
1,487633,80,But the administration has avoided talking about one crucial area of war strategy altogether how it might end,NULL,0
1,487633,80,But nearly all wars end in negotiations,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The global economic costs of the conflict are already enormous and will almost certainly increase with the onset of winter,NULL,0
1,487633,80,It must think through the right timing to push for negotiations and at what point the costs of continuing to fight will outweigh the benefits,NULL,0
1,487633,80,If the administration does not prepare soon it may find its carefully calibrated response to the war being overtaken by a dangerous fantasy of absolute victory,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The administration has also carefully avoided talking about what comes next claiming that it is up to Ukrainians to decide what is in their best interest,NULL,0
1,487633,80,But maintaining that position is becoming more difficult now that Russian President Vladimir Putin has doubled down on the war and made blatant nuclear threats against the West,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Putin has chosen to take significant new risks rather than to back down suggesting that this war will not end through simple Russian capitulation,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Though these risks seem manageable for now the time may come when negotiations are necessary to forestall catastrophe,NULL,0
1,487633,80,At the same time the economic fallout of the war is rapidly growing,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In Ukraine public finances have been ravaged; the country is running out of cash,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In reality the question is not whether negotiations are needed to end the war but when and how they should unfold,NULL,0
1,487633,80,To lay the groundwork for a settlement American policymakers must act to ensure that Ukrainian American and European interests do not diverge,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Ukrainian interests are not necessarily identical to those of its Western partners,NULL,0
1,487633,80,European states are bearing substantial economic costs from the war,NULL,0
1,487633,80,And any risk of escalation or nuclear exchange poses a direct threat to the West itself,NULL,0
1,487633,80,This does not mean that the West should push Ukraine to concede as some have argued,NULL,0
1,487633,80,But it does suggest that the United States and its partners should provide future aid with an eye to putting Ukraine in the best negotiating position not simply continuing the war,NULL,0
1,487633,80,These goals should be narrow by design rather than trying to retake all of its pre2014 territory or to punish Russian leaders Ukraine should pursue objectives that are less likely to produce dramatic escalation and more likely to result in a durable peace,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Washington should encourage pursuing those objectives and should also make clear to Kyiv at least in private where the limits of American support lie and what the White House perceives as unacceptable escalation risks,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Setting clear expectations now reduces the risk of misperception in Kyiv,NULL,0
1,487633,80,American policymakers must also consider Ukrainian and Russian domestic politics since internal support in both countries will be vital to making any settlement last,NULL,0
1,487633,80,History suggests that a power transition in Moscow is possible but by no means likely or inevitable,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Thus policymakers need to focus on Putin and the small group of elites around him and consider what settlement they might be willing to accept,NULL,0
1,487633,80,But like many other authoritarians before him he can sell a poor result as a win,NULL,0
1,487633,80,This means that it may be possible to find some facesaving deal in which de facto realities such as Russian legal control of Crimea could be recognized and which the Kremlin could portray to the Russian public as genuine concessions by the West,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In Kyiv Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky faces a more open contentious political environment as the divisions of Ukrainian politics begin to reemerge,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Nonetheless he faces a similar dilemma,NULL,0
1,487633,80,After asking so much of Ukrainians the Ukrainian government will find it difficult to compromise in any way that seems to reward the enemy,NULL,0
1,487633,80,If Zelensky accepts an unpopular settlement it could lead to his defeat at the ballot box,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In these circumstances a deal in which Ukrainians feel that they have largely triumphed is more likely to succeed,NULL,0
1,487633,80,This makes it all the more important to manage expectations now,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Washington should encourage Kyiv to take a more moderate stance on issues such as Crimea that are likely to figure in a future settlement; to tone down triumphalist talk; and to emphasize the economic rewards that Ukraine stands to receive through international reconstruction aid and European economic integration under a settlement,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Policymakers should set clear basic parameters for a settlement but have significant flexibility in many details,NULL,0
1,487633,80,A few points are nonnegotiable,NULL,0
1,487633,80,But there are other issues on which flexibility is possible,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Final territorial borders for example may be determined partly by military gains on the ground,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Policymakers should not be irrevocably devoted to the preFebruary 24 or even pre2014 status quo,NULL,0
1,487633,80,And in general policymakers should seek to prioritize practical outcomes over abstract principles,NULL,0
1,487633,80,An independent sovereign Ukraine that can defend itself and integrate economically with Europe for example would be far preferable to a Ukraine with permanent territorial disputes within its borders,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The situation in Ukraine remains dynamic; US,NULL,0
1,487633,80,policymakers should avoid tying their own hands now with declarations that may be hard to achieve in practice,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Meanwhile sanctions relief is likely to be one of the most important but politically fraught parts of any negotiation for Western policymakers,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Sanctions tend to turn into permanent features of international politics even though their economic and political impact weakens over time,NULL,0
1,487633,80,They are therefore often more useful as bargaining chips than as permanent punishment,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Policymakers should think carefully now about how to use sanctions relief to obtain Russian concessions,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Some sanctions relief for Russia will likely be a prerequisite for a successful peace deal but policymakers should think carefully about which sanctions are worth lifting,NULL,0
1,487633,80,There are three circumstances in which it may make sense for the United States to push for a settlement,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The first is if Ukrainian forces continue to achieve significant success and leadership in Kyiv begins to talk about liberating Crimea,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The second is if Russian forces regain the initiative and retake significant territory particularly if they begin to advance out of the Donbas,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The third is if the two sides become locked in another stalemate with neither able to regain the advantage,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In such a situation the United States Europe and even Ukraine and Russia may conclude that it is no longer worth bearing the substantial costs of continuing the war,NULL,0
1,487633,80,At first glance it may seem strange that US,NULL,0
1,487633,80,policymakers should consider a settlement when Ukraine is winning when it is losing and when it is doing neither,NULL,0
1,487633,80,And each of the situations outlined above would likely produce wildly different settlements,NULL,0
1,487633,80,But what connects all three is that in each battlefield outcomes point to a relative consensus around which a settlement could be built,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Today the battlefield is still dynamic; both parties think they are going to triumph,NULL,0
1,487633,80,A settlement will become possible only when the outcome on the battlefield becomes more apparent,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Until then robust Western support can help ensure that the first of these scenarios is the most likely,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Recent airstrikes against Kyiv and other major Ukrainian cities suggest that Russia may be contemplating greater escalation,NULL,0
1,487633,80,There are substantial risks and costs to a widening conflict; even if it is not yet the time to negotiate policymakers need to explore now the circumstances under which the United States would push for an end to the war,NULL,0
1,487633,80,They should think through how to effectively leverage sanctions and battlefield gains to put Ukraine in the best position at the negotiating table,NULL,0
1,487633,80,And perhaps most important policymakers in Washington should communicate the results of these discussions to Kyiv and to European capitals in order to avoid potentially dangerous divergences in national interest among Ukraine and its Western partners,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Since Russia began its partial mobilization in September thousands of men of military age have fled abroad to avoid being called up for the war in Ukraine,NULL,0
1,487633,80,How are their wives coping?,NULL,0

1,487633,80,The Russian Ministry of Defense said in a statement Monday that all partial mobilization activities including summons deliveries have been suspended,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Military units will only be accepting volunteers and contractors from now on the statement continued,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Commenting on behalf of the Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu the ministry said that the commanders of military districts and the Northern Fleet were sent orders to submit reports on the completion of partial mobilization activities by November 1,NULL,0

1,487633,80,The benefits of the mobilization have also been questionable,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Firstly Iran appears to be playing a significant role in arming Russia,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Then there is the strong indication Russia has been running very low on its own stock of missiles,NULL,0
1,487633,80,And finally this new level of intensity means Ukraine is going to need help from the West if this new influx of missiles is to be stopped,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In recent weeks despite Iranian and Russian denials images of the Shahed136 drones their distinctive delta wings silhouetted against the sky have circulated around the global media,NULL,0

1,487633,80,Launched in packs these drones are designed to fly low evading radar,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Their low altitude and slow speed mean they can be shot down by individual soldiers as many have been but they can also be used against frontline positions and are more manoeuvrable than faster missiles,NULL,0
1,487633,80,With their 40kg warheads the Shahed136s which are accurate machines cause significant damage,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Meanwhile in this hightempo conflict with Ukraine that has only run a few months Russia has used up most of its missile inventory,NULL,0
1,487633,80,With the economy still on a peacetime footing there is no quick way to replenish its rapidly dwindling stocks,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Russian missiles while advanced are expensive and timeconsuming to make,NULL,0
1,487633,80,With most of the world having either turned against the invading nation or cowed by sanctions from doing business with Russia it has few partners to turn to,NULL,0
1,487633,80,One of the ironies of sanctions against Iran is that it now has a robust militaryindustrial complex with a particular focus on drones and short to mediumrange missiles,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Tehran has steadily improved on domestic designs incrementally increasing range accuracy and survivability of longrange drones loitering munitions and a large and growing arsenal of missiles like the Fateh110 and the more advanced variant the Zolfaghar,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Both are roadmobile and solidfuelled meaning they can emerge from a hidden position and launch within minutes before ducking back under cover,NULL,0
1,487633,80,This makes them more likely to survive any potential conflict,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Their ranges 300500km for the Fatehemobin (an improved version) and 700km for the Zolfaghar make them useful for theatrelevel warfare while their accuracy down to a few metres and constantly being improved allows them to hit specific point targets like bridges command posts and missile batteries,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Questions are being asked at the United Nations Security Council about whether Iran has broken its treaty obligations by actively supporting Russia a pariah on the world stage,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Even so Iran has something to gain,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Though many different models and types of drones and missiles are being manufactured there the true test of any weapon system is the brutal school of combat for which there are no prizes for second place,NULL,0
1,487633,80,This feedback to Iranian analysts and weapons designers will help improve future missiles and drones making them all the more lethal,NULL,0
1,487633,80,So Russia has little option but to import relatively cheap effective Iranian missiles,NULL,0
1,487633,80,So how has Ukraine been impacted?,NULL,0
1,487633,80,At the start of the war Ukraine had S300 and Buk air defence systems capable of longrange defence against fastmoving targets and able to tackle slower yet lowaltitude flying cruise missiles,NULL,0
1,487633,80,A protracted intense conflict means Ukraine is also short on sophisticated weapons and is not able to buy replacement missiles in anywhere near the amounts it needs to sustain a campaign,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The recent Russian strikes highlight how badly Ukraine needs Western air defence systems,NULL,0
1,487633,80,This comes at a time when Western help is starting to plateau with NATO militaries now looking to their own depleted stocks,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Again complex weapons systems take time to build,NULL,0
1,487633,80,For it to be effective air defence needs to be multilayered,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Highspeed longrange weapons are needed to counter incoming ballistic missiles with minimum speeds of 2000 to 3000kmh (1240mph to 1865mph) with many models flying much faster in the true hypersonic range of Mach 5 or higher,NULL,0
1,487633,80,These systems need sophisticated radars that can track multiple fastmoving objects identifying them and predicting their path so air defence missiles can be fired in the right place at the right time to intercept and destroy,NULL,0
1,487633,80,These advanced weapons have now started to arrive,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The first NASAMS or National Advanced SurfacetoAir Missile Systems arrived in Ukraine in September,NULL,0
1,487633,80,A Norwegian US collaboration NASAMS has distributed radars that can spot and track a variety of targets over a very wide area extremely suitable for protecting the vast Ukrainian landscape,NULL,0
1,487633,80,NASAMS can also incorporate very different air defence systems into its architecture meaning Ukraine can add weapons systems to it integrating them into one effective air defence umbrella that is capable of growing in effectiveness as it increases in size,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Germany has rushed four of its shorttomediumranged IRIST Air defence missile systems to Ukraine,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The IRIST is so new that it has never been tested in combat,NULL,0
1,487633,80,There is one proWestern country however which already possesses an effective multilayered advanced air defence system,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Ukraine which has strong cultural ties with Israel was surprised when it was recently rebuffed for purchases of the shortrange Iron Dome and mediumrange Barak 8 air defence weapons,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Israel is pushing to export both weapons to several countries interested in buying but it has refused to sell to Ukraine because such a move could trigger a Russian military response,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Russia controls much of Syrian airspace and Israeli jets regularly pound targets in and around Damascus and parts of southern Syria,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Iranian military convoys allegedly carrying missiles and drones have been repeatedly attacked by Israeli fighter jets,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In late October a suspected Iranian dronemaking factory was destroyed near the capital Damascus in a rare daytime air strike by Israeli aircraft,NULL,0
1,487633,80,While Ukrainians may be certain in their minds of eventual victory that initial optimism has been tempered by the realisation that the war is likely to be more drawn out than people had realised,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Summary Hiked preparedness seen lasting a year could be longer,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Norway is now Europes largest gas supplier,NULL,0

1,487633,80,Norway will also seek to bring its new fleet of USmade P8 Poseidon submarinehunting maritime patrol aircraft into regular operation at a faster pace than originally planned the chief of defence General Eirik Kristoffersen said,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The scale of alert on which the military operates is classified however and the government declined to give details of the level,NULL,0
1,487633,80,We have seen an escalation (in the war) in Ukraine we (Norway) are training Ukrainian forces the Ukraine war has changed with the Russian mobilisation he said an interview,NULL,0
1,487633,80,And at the same time we have had a gas explosion in the Baltic Sea and drone activity at North Sea platforms,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The raised level is expected to last a year possibly more Kristoffersen added,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Norway first deployed its military to guard offshore platforms and onshore facilities after leaks on the Nord Stream pipelines on Sept,NULL,0

1,487633,80,NATO member Norway shares a nearly 200 km (125 mile) land border with Russia in the Arctic as well as a vast maritime border,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The Nordic nation of 54 million people is also now the biggest exporter of natural gas to the European Union accounting for around a quarter of all EU imports after a drop in Russian flows,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The continuation of the war in Ukraine Russias attempts at weakening (international) support for Ukraine mean that all countries in Europe must consider that they are exposed to hybrid threats,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The armed forces will spend less time training and more time on operational duties,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The Home Guard a rapid mobilisation force will play a more active role,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The air force had called off training in the United States with its F35 fighter jets preferring to keep them in Norway said Kristoffersen,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Many of the newly mobilised soldiers Moscow has sent to the Ukraine frontline in recent weeks are armed with barely usable weapons according to British defence analysts,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The Kremlin declared a partial mobilisation of up to 300000 reservists in September but the Ministry of Defence believes they could be using weapons that date back to the 1950s,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Russias newly deployed reservists are thought in many cases to be poorly equipped as Moscow struggles with strained logistics systems,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Open source images suggest that the troops have been issued with rifles of a type which could be over 60 years old,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The intelligence update posted by the MoD on Twitter said In September Russian officers were concerned that some recently mobilised reservists were arriving in Ukraine without weapons,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Open source images suggest that those rifles which have been issued to mobilised reservists are typically AKMs a weapon first introduced in 1959,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Many are likely in barely usable condition following poor storage,NULL,0
1,487633,80,AKM fires 762mm ammunition while Russias regular combat units are mostly armed with 545mm AK74M or AK12 rifles,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The integration of reservists with contract soldiers and combat veterans in Ukraine will mean Russian logisticians will have to push two types of small arms ammunition to frontline positions rather than one,NULL,0
1,487633,80,This will likely further complicate Russias already strained logistics systems,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The AKM is an assault rifle designed by Soviet firearms designer Mikhail Kalashnikov as a replacement for the more famous AK47,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Experts say it is the most widely used of the Kalashnikov rifles,NULL,0
1,487633,80,It remains in use around the world but was officially replaced in Soviet frontline service by the AK74 in the late 1970s,NULL,0
1,487633,80,It comes amid renewed Russian air assaults on Ukrainian infrastructure,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Ukraine war live 80% of Kyiv without water as Russia hits key infrastructure  and emergency blackouts begin,NULL,0

1,487633,80,Over 50 missiles struck Ukraine overnight which is a marked increase in comparison the attacks over the past eight months,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Sean Bell a retired airvice marshal told Sky News Vladimir Putin was striking nonmilitary targets in a bid to demoralise and terrorise the Ukrainian population,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The irony is for most of the Ukrainians this will have quite the opposite effect it will galvanise their support and harden their resolve he said,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he hopes US President Joe Biden has the wisdom to deal with a global confrontation similar to the 1962 Cuban missile crisis referencing the war on Ukraine,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In October 1962 a Soviet submarine captain wanted to launch a nuclear weapon after the US Navy dropped depth charges around the submarine,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Later that day Kennedy secretly agreed to remove all US missiles from Turkey in exchange for Khrushchev removing the same from Cuba,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The crisis was defused though it became a symbol of the perils of superpower rivalry in the Cold War,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Lavrov said the Russian leadership including President Vladimir Putin is still prepared for discussions on Ukraine,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The US and its European allies say Russian concerns are overblown and cannot justify the invasion of a former Soviet neighbour whose borders Moscow recognised after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Why did this happen?,NULL,0
1,487633,80,For the second time in my life the threat of nuclear war is keeping me up at night,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Now almost 40 years later that fear has returned as Russian President Vladimir Putin issues threats of nuclear use seemingly to compensate for the poor performance of his armed forces fighting in Ukraine,NULL,0
1,487633,80,While Russia and the United States issue competing threats it is important to understand the different pathways to nuclear escalation that could emerge from the war in Ukraine,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Of course any conventional conflict involving a nucleararmed power has the potential to escalate,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In this case Putin believes that Russia is in a highstakes conflict,NULL,0
1,487633,80,He envisioned a quick and decisive victory; instead Ukrainian forces have shown a greater will to fight and have Russian forces on the run even retreating from newly annexed territories,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Under these circumstances nuclear weapons could be the ace in the hole an instrument for reversing defeats on the battlefield,NULL,0
1,487633,80,and its NATO allies are no strangers to this type of strategy,NULL,0
1,487633,80,During the Cold War the Western alliance followed the strategy of flexible response threatening to use nuclear weapons to defeat what many considered the conventionally superior armed forces of the Warsaw Pact,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The alliance would respond to an invasion first with lowyield battlefield nuclear weapons reserving the ability to escalate to greater nuclear use if Warsaw Pact members did not withdraw,NULL,0
1,487633,80,NATO took numerous steps to convince Soviet leaders that this threat was credible,NULL,0
1,487633,80,policymakers should assume Russia today might make the same calculation about its war in Ukraine,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Even NATO seems to understand Russia cares deeply about what happens in Ukraine,NULL,0
1,487633,80,What then are the paths to nuclear use in the Ukraine war? One road to escalation could involve the deliberate use of nuclear weapons by Russia,NULL,0
1,487633,80,For example the collapse of Russian armed forces in Ukraine especially the portions of the country recently annexed could prompt Putin to conduct a handful of attacks with lowyield nuclear weapons to compel his opponents to back down,NULL,0
1,487633,80,This is foolish and dangerous,NULL,0
1,487633,80,This possibility likely deterred the Biden administration from creating a nofly zone over Ukraine,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Despite calls from former national security officials US,NULL,0
1,487633,80,officials seemed to understand the nuclear risks,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Even if Putin were to resist deliberate nuclear use in response to direct NATO military intervention there would be the danger of inadvertent escalation,NULL,0
1,487633,80,How NATO fights conventionally could look like efforts to disarm Russia of its nuclear weapons,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Similarly there would be the possibility of accidental escalation,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Both sides would face tremendous stress to keep control of their nuclear forces while fighting an intense conventional war,NULL,0
1,487633,80,NATO military intervention then would likely provoke more nuclear escalation,NULL,0
1,487633,80,With these escalation dynamics in mind the US,NULL,0
1,487633,80,and its allies need to start thinking about ending the conventional war in Ukraine rather than prolonging it,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Like it or not Putin sees this as a highstakes conflict,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Although it is in US,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Now is the time for the US,NULL,0
1,487633,80,to start thinking about creating offramps to terminate the war and balance these interests,NULL,0
1,487633,80,It would not be the first time American policymakers pressured partners against taking actions that might cause a war to escalate,NULL,0

1,487633,80,It is also the first proxy war between nucleararmed powers since the Russian intervention into Syria,NULL,0
1,487633,80,It is therefore not unreasonable to ask what the effects of the Ukraine conflict are beyond that country and Europe,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The Korean War played a significant role in hardening the Cold War standoff not only through prompting the creation of US alliances in Asia but in deepening commitments to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact in Europe,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In each country in Asia analysts and policymakers are watching the Ukraine war closely and consciously and unconsciously deriving lessons from it what do events in Ukraine imply for other countries in terms of what is possible what is risky and what competitors may be emboldened to try? Perceptions of the conflict are coalescing around four fundamental questions why did the war break out?; how is the war being fought?; what does the war mean for global order?; and when and under what conditions will it come to an end? In the debates that attend each of these questions we can start to see some of the broader implications of the Ukraine war for Asia,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Why did the war break out?,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The obvious answer to this question is that Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022; what is more contested is why Russia invaded Ukraine,NULL,0
1,487633,80,A rubicon has been crossed in the significance of information warfare which will have major implications for deepening confrontations in Asia,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The second answer is that Western actions after the Cold War enabled emboldened and provoked the Russian invasion,NULL,0
1,487633,80,By brushing aside considerations of international legitimacy these operations justified the use of force by great powers for their own conceptions of the requirements of order,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The strategic lesson of this interpretation is that order in Asia cannot be entrusted to law and institutions; the best prospect for peace is a concert of nucleararmed great powers holding the ring,NULL,0

1,487633,80,The strategic implications of this argument are that the battle lines are now between democracies and autocracies as the latter tighten their mutual commitments in Asia so must the former cleave closer together,NULL,0
1,487633,80,How is the war being fought?,NULL,0
1,487633,80,There seem to be three aspects of the conduct of the Ukraine war that have implications for strategic dynamics in Asia,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The first is that in this apparently asymmetric contest the smaller party is winning,NULL,0
1,487633,80,A great deal of analysis has been devoted to why Russia has failed to prevail and why Ukraine has not only blunted the invasion but is reversing Russian gains,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Many accounts converge around imbalances in preparation morale and regime type; some on the nature of the terrain; and most on the effectiveness of the military equipment and intelligence supplied to Ukraine by Western countries,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Increasingly sophisticated longrange precision strike weapons the use of electromagnetic pulse to disable air defences and developments in combined arms operations since the 1991 Gulf War had started to tip perceptions of the offencedefence balance decisively in favour of the attacking side in the minds of analysts and policymakers,NULL,0
1,487633,80,It is likely this has been slowed if not reversed by the Ukraine war,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The strategic implications for Asia are promising since perceptions of the potency of offence are generally destabilising because states are anxious about competitors gaining the upper hand by attacking first,NULL,0
1,487633,80,A new appreciation of the power of defence on the other hand has likely made Chinese military planners more cautious about the likelihood of success in an invasion of Taiwan,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Chinese military planners may be more cautious about the likelihood of success in an invasion of Taiwan,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The second aspect of the conduct of the war is the potency of the information war,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Wary of Russian information operations from the 2008 invasion of Georgia to the 2016 US Presidential election Western states have devoted a great deal of time and effort to collecting and publicly presenting intelligence that refutes Russian information operations,NULL,0
1,487633,80,As a result the solidarity within the West and with Ukraine has delivered ongoing materiel and moral support to Ukraine while making it difficult for those inclined to back Russia or to abstain from commenting to justify their positions,NULL,0
1,487633,80,A rubicon has been crossed in the significance of information warfare which will have major implications for deepening confrontations in Asia,NULL,0
1,487633,80,What remains unclear is the ultimate objective for the West,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Third the Ukraine war has provided the United States and its allies with the best opportunity to delegitimise and weaken an authoritarian challenger since the Soviet Union withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The Soviet Union did this in Vietnam in the 1960s; the United States in Afghanistan in the 1980s,NULL,0
1,487633,80,What remains unclear is the ultimate objective for the West,NULL,0
1,487633,80,What does the war mean for global order?,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Denunciations and adverse resolutions carry little weight while the rising stakes in the information war allow incompatible claims to jostle along with little to adjudicate between them,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The sense of a common global order bounded by basic common interests and perceptions is receding with little indication of when the decay will stop,NULL,0
1,487633,80,When great powers cannot even agree on shared interests the grounds for mutual restraint and avoidance of catastrophe will continue to shrink,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Another dangerous domino to fall is the status of nuclear nonproliferation norms,NULL,0
1,487633,80,By invading Ukraine in 2014 and 2022 Russia broke the terms of the 1994 Budapest memorandum under which Ukraine Belarus and Kazakhstan agreed to return Soviet nuclear warheads on their soil to Russia in exchange for an undertaking that they would not be attacked in future by Russia,NULL,0
1,487633,80,As Russian armour rolled towards Kyiv in February those pondering the folly of that deal would not only have been Ukrainian,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Many strategists would have thought back to the attacks on Iraq and Libya and the restraint shown to Pakistan North Korea and Iran to see the distinction between those who surrender their nuclear capabilities and those who press ahead in terms of maintaining their security and sovereignty,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Volodymyr Zelenskyy inspecting the damage in Bucha in May following Russian occupation of the area,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Options for acquiring nuclear weapons must be playing on the minds of policymakers and analysts particularly in Asia,NULL,0
1,487633,80,And as the lines of confrontation between the West and authoritarian nations come into sharper relief over Ukraine it becomes harder to choose one side without alienating the other,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Rising tech decoupling reinforces the logic of choice over the logic of options,NULL,0
1,487633,80,This is uncomfortable territory for India Indonesia and many other countries in Asia that prefer multialignment as a grand strategy for managing turbulence in their international relations,NULL,0
1,487633,80,When and under what conditions will the war end?,NULL,0
1,487633,80,There are broadly three endgames to this war each with its particular strategic implications for Asia,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The one least likely is that Russia prevails,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Somehow Moscow summons the will and materiel to push Ukrainian forces back while blunting the effects of Western military supplies and intelligence,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Russia regains the regions of Ukraine that allegedly have voted to align with Moscow and offers Kyiv a peace deal,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Just as the world lived for decades with the strategic implications of the Korean War so we in Asia will be living with the fallout of the Ukraine War for decades to come,NULL,0
1,487633,80,More likely is that Ukraine wins,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Its operations force Russian troops out of eastern and southern Ukraine but stop short of trying to retake Crimea,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Russia sues for peace on the condition that Western sanctions are lifted and Kyiv recognises the loss of Crimea,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Ukraine joins NATO and the European Union,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Russia having had its reputation and legitimacy shredded becomes ever more reliant on China,NULL,0
1,487633,80,This is a boon to Beijing virtually guaranteeing that exercises of Russian resolve such as putting down unrest in Kazakhstan earlier this year will not be repeated,NULL,0
1,487633,80,With a weak and compliant neighbour along its inner Asian frontier China can devote more attention to the Pacific and Indian Oceans,NULL,0
1,487633,80,But President Xi Jinping will be cautious,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Another possibility is neither side wins,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The war drags on through 2023 and perhaps beyond to an exhausted stalemate,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Support for the war wanes in both Ukraine and Russia as the stunning advances and retreats of 2022 grind towards a bitter war of attrition,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Both sides are aggrieved and bedevilled by terrorist attacks,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Ukraine remains in limbo wanting NATO membership but with Brussels cautious about buying into the fight on these conditions,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The implications of this outcome for Asia could be profound,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Wars through history have been like lightning flashes over a darkened playing field suddenly illuminating the dispositions and vulnerabilities of those on the pitch,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The Ukraine war has been no different,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The intensity and balance of the conflict have revealed the pretensions and possibilities of weapons developed during the information age in ways that other shortrun campaigns did not,NULL,0
1,487633,80,This cannot but shape the perceptions of analysts and policymakers in Asia profoundly,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Just as the world lived for decades with the strategic implications of the Korean War so we in Asia will be living with the fallout of the Ukraine War for decades to come,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The bursts of Ukrainian fire flying over his head at the Russians in their southern stronghold of Kherson down the road gave Oleksandr Prikhodko reason to hope,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The energetic 42 yearold was standing in the sootcovered ruins of the family store he had built on the edge of land Russia suddenly claims as its own,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The Russians smashed his lifes work to smithereens during their second attempt to seize the nearby Ukrainian riverside port of Mykolaiv in July,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Read more Liz Truss was scared Vladimir Putin may fire nukes in last days as UK PM Report,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The Ukrainians have since launched a stirring counterassault that has turned the road between Mykolaiv and Kherson into one of the central axes of the war,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Prikhodko grew up along that road in the onefactory village of Kotlyareve,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The Russians blew up the factory as well,NULL,0
1,487633,80,When you hear news about our successes there is huge psychological relief Prikhodko said between sharp bangs of outgoing rocket fire,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Even tiny things such as seeing a military car drive out to the front and then safely come back makes you feel better he said,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Our lives depend on our soldiers,NULL,0
1,487633,80,And they have to somehow understand that we know that,NULL,0
1,487633,80,A general view of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant on September 11,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The annexation of Zaporizhzhia and three other regions is illegal under international law and has been widely condemned by the international community,NULL,0
1,487633,80,On Tuesday the IAEA said that Murashov will not continue his duties at the nuclear power plant following his release from Russian detention,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Kotin also noted that operational issues at the plant would be resolved by the technical staff by agreement with the central office of the company,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Grossi will also visit Russia in the coming days,NULL,0
1,487633,80,He also said that the IAEA considers the facility Ukrainian,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The war should stop immediately,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Intense Russian shelling near the facility this summer sparked concerns of a nuclear accident prompting the International Atomic Energy Agency to send a team there,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The nuclear plant with six reactors is the largest in Europe,NULL,0
1,487633,80,It continues to be run by Ukrainian technicians but the forcible annexation of Zaporizhzhia means that according to Russian law it is now on Russian territory,NULL,0
1,487633,80,He says the hasty withdrawal of Russian troops from northeastern Ukraine is by no means signaling the last stretch of the war,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Ukraine war update Q&A with Hein Goemans,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Is that possibly signaling the end of the war?,NULL,0
1,487633,80,While unexpected this Ukrainian battle victory is not the beginning of the end of the war,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Individual victories or defeats in a specific battle are often mistakenly read as indicating a change in the likelihood of war termination,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Instead what matters most is whether and how expectations on both sides change,NULL,0
1,487633,80,And in this case clearly Russian expectations of a swift victory have changed,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The proof is in the conscription of 300000 more Russian men some reportedly without any military training or experience,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Russia I think has become more pessimistic about getting its original war aims fulfilled,NULL,0
1,487633,80,You need the opponents to change their mind,NULL,0
1,487633,80,On the other hand Ukraine has perhaps become more optimistic,NULL,0
1,487633,80,If that is true the key point to realize is that the gap between the minimal demands may not have decreased at all,NULL,0
1,487633,80,How do expectations affect war strategy and the likelihood of peace?,NULL,0
1,487633,80,A change in expectations is often more important than a single battle or campaign victory,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Goemans Most people think that if you win a battle or a campaign peace becomes more likely because the other side is defeated and they recognize that they are defeated which makes them more willing to make a deal,NULL,0
1,487633,80,A change in expectations is often more important than a single battle or campaign victory,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Only if something unexpected happened would I change my expectations and my strategy,NULL,0
1,487633,80,You could sustain a military defeat and still get a better deal,NULL,0
1,487633,80,A good example is the Yom Kippur War of 1974,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The attacking Egyptian army was drastically defeated by the Israelis,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Yet the Egyptians got the Sinai back,NULL,0
1,487633,80,They showed themselves a lot more competent than the Israelis had thought after 1967,NULL,0
1,487633,80,So you have this weird case where militarily Egypt lost and still the Egyptians got a better deal in the end which was clearly not a military outcome,NULL,0
1,487633,80,What happened was a change in expectations,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Neither is likely to speed up a ceasefire,NULL,0
1,487633,80,I still expect the war to last at least another year maybe two,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Both sides still have plans and ideas to test before their expectations are likely to converge,NULL,0
1,487633,80,My hands are forced,NULL,0
1,487633,80,But not like this,NULL,0
1,487633,80,That sends a clear message,NULL,0
1,487633,80,How does that work?,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Essentially one side must get the other to change their mind and to convince them that striking a deal now is better than to continue fighting,NULL,0
1,487633,80,We know that some leaders continue fighting for their own survival against the very interests of their country and their own people,NULL,0
1,487633,80,We saw that in Germany in the First and Second World War and also in Japan during World War II,NULL,0
1,487633,80,We political scientists hold that opponents fight in order to find that something that makes peace possible,NULL,0
1,487633,80,But what really is that? One side must get the other to change its mind,NULL,0
1,487633,80,You must get them to agree that making a deal now is better than to continue fighting,NULL,0
1,487633,80,It reminds me of the case of Germany in the First World War where just four months into the war Kaiser Wilhelm II and his cabinet concluded that it was unwinnable,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Yet they fought on for another four years,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Why? Because they knew that if they lost they would be overthrown by a revolution,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Of course they were right,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Leaders in such unwinnable situations are very dangerous,NULL,0
1,487633,80,They are the reason that World War I dragged on much longer than it should have,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Putin also has a domestic problem,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Originally he delayed mass mobilization to avoid domestic unrest against the advice of the political hawks in the Kremlin who want a largerscale war,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Over the past week more than 200000 Russians have fled their country to avoid conscription,NULL,0
1,487633,80,It scares the [expletive] out of me because these people talk about nukes and about attacking Poland and Latvia Lithuania and about nuking Paris and London,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Do the hawks in the Kremlin think Russia can survive an escalation that includes nuclear strikes?,NULL,0
1,487633,80,that they told Putin and the Kremlin nukes would be unacceptable,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Goemans The hawks in the Kremlin think the war has been fought wrongly or poorly,NULL,0
1,487633,80,And in a sense they are right,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The Russian army is just a very weak poor army,NULL,0
1,487633,80,My friend Branislav Slantchev [a Rochester PhD and now a professor of political science at the University of California San Diego] has written about this in a recent terrifying blog post,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In that scenario he said he expects the Russians to use a nuclear weapon under 1 kiloton which he says one could fire with artillery or any of the multiple dualuse rockets and missiles the Russians have in their arsenal,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Of course the United States and the rest of the world would go absolutely bananas,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The thing that really struck me a few days ago is that people in Washington have said very clearly and in very unmistakable terms that they told Putin and the Kremlin nukes would be unacceptable,NULL,0
1,487633,80,So that tells me they are afraid that Russia might actually do it,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The consequences depend on whether Russia wins or loses and on whether Ukraine survives or is dismembered,NULL,0
1,487633,80,As a result the whole security infrastructure in Europe would crumble with direct repercussions for NATO European Union cohesion Germany and the Middle East,NULL,0
1,487633,80,All these policies that have led to peaceful cooperation will all be thrown out creating instability in Europe and affect the United States deeply,NULL,0
1,487633,80,A large part of the stability that we saw during the Cold War era was based on the expectation that the situation would be stable,NULL,0
1,487633,80,It was stable because we expected it to be stable,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In the bestcase scenario Ukraine wins a better deal than before the war,NULL,0
1,487633,80,For me that means more defensible borders which would mean some form of continued Western presence and the arming of Ukraine by the West along with training and funding,NULL,0
1,487633,80,All that would create a much more stable Europe,NULL,0
1,487633,80,I hope that the extremists in Russia would have learned a lesson and everybody in Europe would be on their guard with respect to Russia for another generation or two,NULL,0
1,487633,80,How is the war in Ukraine affecting Russia the Russian people?,NULL,0
1,487633,80,On top of the sanctions the brain drain is tremendous as is the exodus of young and middleaged educated males who have the means and who are worried about being conscripted,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Add to that the mounting numbers of dead soldiers Russia is going to have an acute shortage of men which will create all kinds of economic and societal problems,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Maybe a return to the status quo before February 24 and internationally overseen plebiscites in Luhansk Donetsk and Crimea,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Goemans Their army is poor their equipment is rotten and the sanctions make it impossible to build new equipment to update their machinery,NULL,0

1,487633,80,Foreign Secretary James Cleverly also urged Russia not to impede grain exports and said that increasingly desperate statements from the Kremlin were designed to distract from its faltering war effort,NULL,0
1,487633,80,No other country is talking about nuclear use,NULL,0
1,487633,80,No country is threatening Russia or President Putin Cleverly told lawmakers,NULL,0
1,487633,80,He should be clear that for the UK and our Allies any use at all of nuclear weapons would change the nature of the conflict,NULL,0
1,487633,80,There would be severe consequences for Russia,NULL,0

1,487633,80,The Russian ministry also said that British specialists from the same unit directed Ukrainian drone attacks on ships of Russian Black Sea fleet in Crimea on Saturday,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Cleverly did not directly reference those comments,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Without detailing what he was referring to he said Now the Kremlin is resorting to peddling false claims churning out invented stories that say more about the fractures within Russias government than they do about us,NULL,0

1,487633,80,On October 10 Russia rained dozens of missile strikes on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv and some nine other cities many deep into the country and away from the battlefield,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The strikes killed at least 14 people and injured more than 90 others according to Ukrainian officials and in the days since Russia has continued to strike military and energy infrastructure targets across the country,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Seven months in the war remains unpredictable as Russia and Ukraine seek to advance their own interests before the harsh winter ahead,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Late last month Putin announced that Russia had in an illegal move annexed four occupied regions in Ukraine,NULL,0
1,487633,80,On October 19 he declared martial law in those territories,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Despite those two proclamations Ukraine has actually expanded the territory it controls and Russian troops retreated from the city of Lyman,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Ukrainian also gained ground in Kherson one of the regions that Putin had annexed,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Putin had already mobilized hundreds of thousands of Russians as just as many Russians seem to be fleeing the country to avoid fighting in the conflict,NULL,0
1,487633,80,But there are still big questions about where the war goes from here and what will shape the conflict this winter and onward,NULL,0
1,487633,80,To understand them I spoke with experts on Europe Russia and international security and listened to European leaders speaking candidly on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly last month,NULL,0
1,487633,80,1) Will war fatigue overtake Europe and the US?,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The war is being fought in Ukraine and Ukrainians are certainly suffering the most,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Western support for Ukraine is a crucial variable,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The sanctions that the US Western Europe and some Asian countries have imposed on Russia continue to have a boomerang effect on the world economy,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The winter ahead will change the fighting conditions on the ground and equally importantly the cold weather will remind Europe of its dependence on Russian fossil fuels for heat,NULL,0
1,487633,80,If inflation continues and the energy crisis looms will the US and an at times divided Europe become fatigued with the war and become less inclined to support it?,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The US has sent more than $17 billion in military assistance to Ukraine,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Some defense experts are warning that the conflict is consuming weapons stockpiles faster than nations can refill them,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Another recent survey of 14 countries in Europe and North America from the German Marshall Fund found that in Italy France and Canada climate is viewed as the primary security challenge while the countries closer to Russia and Ukraine on the eastern edges of Europe named Russia or wars between countries,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Nathalie Tocci director of the Istituto Affari Internazionali in Rome told me that the European Commission has not held up its commitments,NULL,0
1,487633,80,She says the sluggishness in disbursing economic aid to Ukraine is partly political but mostly due to bureaucratic hurdles,NULL,0
1,487633,80,So far European countries even Hungary have largely supported Ukraine,NULL,0
1,487633,80,But for European leaders staunchly backing Ukraine political challenges may emerge as the war further exacerbates domestic economic issues,NULL,0
1,487633,80,French President Emmanuel Macron lost his parliamentary majority in June,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Since the Cold War the US has put most of its military and diplomatic focus on first the Middle East and then more recently Asia,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The Biden administration has been hugely successful in dispatching US diplomats to unify Europe but Washington is still operating with a deficit on the continent and without a deep understanding of a sustainable longterm Europe policy,NULL,0
1,487633,80,2) What risks is Putin willing to take?,NULL,0
1,487633,80,His unpredictability is a major X factor,NULL,0
1,487633,80,That could mean an increasingly desperate Putin,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Nowhere has that desperation been more apparent than in the rhetoric surrounding nuclear weapons,NULL,0
1,487633,80,That would be normshattering and earthshattering figuratively and literally,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Even threatening to use a nuke violates the norms of international relations,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Putin has emphasized that the United States was the only country that had used a nuclear weapon (twice) on Japan during World War II,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Another concern is if things continue to go badly for Putin whether he will expand the theater of war to other fronts and countries,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In the category of desperate acts falls what may potentially be an act of selfsabotage a Russian attack on the Nord Stream gas pipeline,NULL,0
1,487633,80,It raises concerns that Russia may attack other critical energy infrastructure in Europe,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The nationalists in Russia according to McGlynn may pose the biggest threat to Putin as they push him toward even more extreme means,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The extent to which Putin might be willing to repress Russians is also important,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The calling up of reserves is one indicator as is the shuttering of the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta and other media outlets and the arrests of critics and activists,NULL,0
1,487633,80,That intensity of repression also limits the possibility for Russian domestic opposition standing up to Putin,NULL,0
1,487633,80,3) What is the definition of Ukraine winning?,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The country that so many analysts predicted would fall in the first week of the invasion in February has endured the first 200 days of war and Ukrainians say they are confident in carrying on the fight so long as they have ample support from the West,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Not because Ukrainians are so brave or have so many resources she explained,NULL,0
1,487633,80,But there is a great deal of confusion as to how anyone defines victory,NULL,0
1,487633,80,While the Ukrainians have expanded their demands in light of their successful counteroffensive and are now talking about nothing short of retaking the territory Russian has occupied since 2014 the United States and each European country seem to hold their own perspective,NULL,0
1,487633,80,And now he has annexed four provinces that he has long sought,NULL,0
1,487633,80,That would mean stretching the war on as long as possible hence the massive mobilization and the possibility of a war of attrition,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In Washington meanwhile there has been little talk of what diplomacy among the parties might look like,NULL,0
1,487633,80,More communication could help,NULL,0
1,487633,80,And the recent Data for Progress survey emphasized that a majority of Americans would like to see more diplomacy,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In the meantime Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan hosted talks between senior officials from Azerbaijan and Armenia last month but the Biden administration has hardly been discussing avenues for diplomacy with Russia,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The US has alienated broad swaths of the Russian population through sanctions and Biden has framed the conflict as an existential one between democracy and autocracy,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Cycling past a destroyed Russian tank in the recently liberated village of PiskyRadkivski on Monday,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Ivor Prickett for The New York Times,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Still in full combat uniform with body armor and boots he had been missed by the crews gathering the dead,NULL,0
1,487633,80,A week after Ukrainian troops seized back the village of PiskyRadkivski in the Kharkiv region in a sweeping counteroffensive that forced Russian troops into retreat across northeastern Ukraine the horror of war was all too evident,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Putin of Russia said last week his country was annexing and treating as its own,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The battle lasted just one day in PiskyRadkivski but the power and accuracy of the Ukrainian assault was evident,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Burnedout tanks sat still in their positions at a crossroads and in the woods at the northern edge of the village,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Russian uniforms sleeping bags and rations lay abandoned among the fir trees opposite Ms,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Ukrainian artillery knocked out the tanks and killed at least eight Russian soldiers here said Anatolii 52 a retired engineer whose house was damaged in the strikes,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Most of the bodies had been removed by professional crews who tour the battle zone in white vans emblazoned with a red cross and the number 200 the code the military has used since Soviet times for cargo of dead soldiers,NULL,0
1,487633,80,But they had not picked up the body by the tree which was missing its head,NULL,0
1,487633,80,On a road past several villages to the south a forensic team was picking up Russian bodies at the scene of an ambush,NULL,0
1,487633,80,A Ukrainian soldier protested but the forensic team explained quietly that Russian bodies could be exchanged for Ukrainian soldiers,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The soldier helped lift a decomposed body into a black body bag then leaned over to retch in the grass,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Down the road soldiers from a Ukrainian tank crew pulled up near the body of another dead Russian soldier who lay twisted where he had fallen his face blackened and his body swollen,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Weary and dirty the tank crew showed little concern for the Russian bodies but seemed tense and angry from their recent battles,NULL,0
1,487633,80,They had been fighting for 51 days without a break and were still wearing their summer uniforms said one of them who gave his code name as Positiv,NULL,0
1,487633,80,While fantasies can be created about the encroachment of NATO as driving Putins decision process leading to launching his war the reality is that he started the war because he thought he would win,NULL,0
1,487633,80,If he had seen prospects for failure he would not have started the war,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Putin appears to have made the decision to gain control of Ukraine in 2011,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Aleksey Kudrin resigned then as finance minister because Putin made the decision to abandon modernisation of the Russian economy to opt for military buildup to restore Russian power,NULL,0
1,487633,80,At that point NATO had no defensive doctrine against Russian aggression in Europe,NULL,0
1,487633,80,A Russian invasion of Ukraine would have been viewed as highly implausible,NULL,0
1,487633,80,France was ready to sell Russia Mistral assault ships and Germany and other NATO members were cutting deals with Russia,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Concurrently Ukrainians were seeking a pathway to Europe,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The autonomous Crimean government opened tourism offices in European cities and the proRussia Yanukovych government negotiated an Association Agreement with the EU,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The parliament of Ukraine had approved the Association agreement 319 votes out of 449 possible in May 2013,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Gallup polls in Crimea in May 2013 showed 52% preferred to be an autonomous republic of Ukraine 22% had a preference for Russia while 20% preferred sovereignty,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Having made the decision to not modernize the economy Putin doubled down on oil gas and other resources as central to the Russian economy,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In effect Putin bet Russias future on fossil fuels while the international community was readying to sign the Paris Climate agreement aimed at reducing fossil fuel use,NULL,0
1,487633,80,As winter approached Putin pressured Yanukovych to abandon the agreement with the EU and to choose Russias Eurasian Union,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The parliament was not involved in this decision,NULL,0
1,487633,80,As Putin no doubt expected massive demonstrations resulted that Yanukovych could not stop without bloodshed,NULL,0
1,487633,80,This created conditions for Putin to move on Ukraine,NULL,0
1,487633,80,If civil war had broken out Putin could have responded to restore order,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The demonstrators however resisted the provocations that were launched,NULL,0
1,487633,80,When Yanukovych showed willingness to negotiate with the demonstrators snipers killed nearly 100 people foreclosing sealing Yanukovychs fate,NULL,0
1,487633,80,He was no longer useful to Putin and he opposed Russian annexation of Crimea,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Igor Girkin was sent to the Donbas to start a war after the successful annexation of Crimea,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Girkin boasted that the people did not want to fight until he Strelkov made war unavoidable,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Strelkov was removed a few months later because Putin was not yet ready to fight to control Ukraine,NULL,0
1,487633,80,That would take further buildup of the military the construction of the Kerch bridge and more,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In 2022 Putins intelligence showed that Russian forces would take Kyiv in days and install Yanukovych as the legitimate president of Ukraine with sufficient Russian forces available to suppress any resistance,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The intelligence was highly flawed because the Russian intelligence services were highly corrupt,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Money intended to payoff people in Ukraine had been diverted to personal accounts,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The planned coup failed and Zelensky chose to stay and fight,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Putin has made terribly serious mistakes,NULL,0
1,487633,80,He offers no possibility of stabilizing Eurasia and as a result is no longer useful to China is a danger to Europe and a burden to his own people,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Ukraines counteroffensive in the east and south of the country continues to build momentum with President Zelenskyy announcing last night that there were new liberated settlements in several regions,NULL,0
1,487633,80,On Monday Ukrainian forces saw more successes on the battlefield pushing through Russian defenses in the south of the country as well as consolidating their hold on territory around Lyman in the eastern Donetsk region and looking to push further into neighboring Luhansk,NULL,0
1,487633,80,President Putin announced Russia was annexing both regions last Friday as well as Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south but Moscows hold on them looks increasingly fragile with none of the regions fully occupied by Russian forces,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In his nightly address the Ukrainian president said fierce fighting continues in many areas of the front but said an increasing number of occupying forces were trying to escape and more and more losses are being inflicted on the enemy army,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Zelenskyy said Russian men who had been mobilized to fight in Ukraine just a few weeks ago were already dying in Ukraine,NULL,0

1,487633,80,I dont really know one way or the other yet,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Thats a real possibility now,NULL,0
1,487633,80,One player in particular who was caught up in the geopolitical maelstrom Flyers prospect Ivan Fedotov who was expected to compete for Philadelphias backup goaltending position this season,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Fedotov played last season for the KHLs CSKA Moscow which is considered an extension of the Russian Army,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Fedotov signed a contract with the Flyers in May and two months later while skating at a rink in St Petersburg he was arrested by a SWAT team and sent to a military base in Severomorsk,NULL,0
1,487633,80,All men ages 18 27 in Russia must serve in the military unless they have an official exemption which is usually university studies,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Fedotov was detained on grounds of military evasion,NULL,0
1,487633,80,This type of snatching and sending young men to arctic bases has been used as retaliation against opposition figures in Russia Washington Post Russia correspondent Mary Ilyushina explained to ESPN,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In this case it may not have to do with opposition but rather abandoning a Russia club for an American one,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Fedotov hired a military lawyer who reported that Fedotov was hospitalized after receiving some kind of injections Fedotov has since been transferred to another base,NULL,0
1,487633,80,His legal team dropped his appeal for the charges of evasion and according to sources he is hopeful that after serving a year in the military he will be released and allowed to come to the United States to begin his NHL career,NULL,0
1,487633,80,This is a case the league is following closely as it could be the first example of the NHL and KHL memorandum being violated,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Considering CSKA Moscows relationship with the military its possible Fedotov could be required to play for CSKA Moscow,NULL,0
1,487633,80,One general manager said hes not as concerned for wellestablished veterans but more so for the prospects and younger players in the league,NULL,0
1,487633,80,They seem more susceptible to getting caught up with military service et cetera the GM said,NULL,0

1,487633,80,The draft and Russian prospects,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Many in the scouting community predicted that Russians would be shut out of the first round of the 2022 NHL draft for the first time since 2005,NULL,0

1,487633,80,Miroshnichenko is more of a risk,NULL,0
1,487633,80,He was once projected as a lottery pick but dropped because he was still in Russia playing in the second division last season and because he will miss the 202223 season after being diagnosed with nonHodgkins lymphoma,NULL,0

1,487633,80,Several NHL teams have pulled scouts from Russia but its hard to gauge how many organizations have a Russian presence as some teams may have consultants on payroll,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Either way Michkov will go the entire season with very few people from NHL organizations having eyes on him,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Scouts say it helps that Michkov has played in wellattended tournaments over the past two years such as the HlinkaGretzky Cup and the 2021 world juniors in Texas,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Michkov is under contract with the KHL through the 202526 season,NULL,0
1,487633,80,At those tournaments he looked like a worldclass talent someone worthy of going toptwo three of the draft one veteran amateur scout said,NULL,0
1,487633,80,But I wouldnt be shocked if theres a precipitous drop simply because of the circumstance,NULL,0

1,487633,80,For the past eight years the West has consistently lagged behind events and handed the initiative to the Kremlin as Russia has escalated its aggression against Ukraine,NULL,0

1,487633,80,Again and again peace plans are proposed that ask nothing of Russia while calling on Kyiv to cede Ukrainian land in exchange for peace in Europe,NULL,0

1,487633,80,This may take longer than expected and could lead to growing Ukraine fatigue in Western capitals,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Nevertheless it is both morally and strategically the right thing to do,NULL,0
1,487633,80,This victory would have farreaching repercussions for the wider region,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Crucially the survival of the Ukrainian nation would serve as a severe blow to the imperial mindset that remains dominant in modern Russia,NULL,0
1,487633,80,This is a necessary step if postwar Russia is ever to establish normal relations with its neighbors,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The alternative would be disastrous for the entire Western world,NULL,0
1,487633,80,If Russia is victorious in Ukraine Putin will embark on further international aggression geared towards subjugating his neighbors and undermining the West,NULL,0

1,487633,80,Sometimes Ovchinnikova claims she gets discounts from stores in Russia when she says where the items are going,NULL,0

1,487633,80,The Ukrainian successes have spurred discussion in the West about the prospect for negotiations to end the aggression and at what cost,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Putin also said he would defend his country with nuclear weapons if threatened by the West,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Interview has been edited for clarity and length,NULL,0
1,487633,80,SHORT There are a number of elements which one has to bear in mind,NULL,0
1,487633,80,One and the most important is that the war is not going well for the Russians,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Putin catastrophically miscalculated on several scores He did not expect the Ukrainians to resist as strongly as they have done,NULL,0
1,487633,80,There was never any question that he thought they were going to be welcomed with flowers,NULL,0
1,487633,80,That was the kind of propaganda myth that was put around,NULL,0
1,487633,80,And he miscalculated terribly over the capacities of the Russian army and how extremely poorly it has performed in military terms,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Is it a disaster Not yet,NULL,0
1,487633,80,One has to be very cautious about evaluating this because it is an ongoing situation,NULL,0
1,487633,80,GAZETTE Should the US,NULL,0
1,487633,80,and the West take advantage of this moment as it helps Ukraine put maximum pressure on Russia to end the war militarily? Or is that potentially too risky and would it be better to seize this time to stabilize the situation through negotiations?,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The more that the Ukrainians can push the Russians back the stronger their negotiating position will be,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Eventually all wars end either with complete defeat in other words in a Ukrainian flag flying over the Kremlin and that is not going to happen or with negotiations,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Ukraine is not going to physically move anywhere and nor is Russia,NULL,0
1,487633,80,They are going to continue to be neighbors and eventually they are going to have to find a way to live together,NULL,0
1,487633,80,So negotiations yes,NULL,0
1,487633,80,On this business of pushing Russia back one has to be very careful about or very much aware of Crimea,NULL,0
1,487633,80,That I think would be a casus belli,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Then kind of all bets would be off about how the Russians might react,NULL,0
1,487633,80,GAZETTE If Putin starts to feel as if he is losing the upper hand in the war or losing face at home are people right to worry how he might react?,NULL,0
1,487633,80,It could happen,NULL,0
1,487633,80,There are already fault lines you can see in NATO and the EU about how to react what the longterm plans should be in Ukraine,NULL,0
1,487633,80,But the fault lines have been very much kept under control for now,NULL,0
1,487633,80,All those things on our side are going to be absolutely critical,NULL,0
1,487633,80,On the Russian side I think we are going to need to watch very carefully how public opinion reacts to this partial mobilization,NULL,0
1,487633,80,And finally what it all in the end depends on is the situation on the battlefield,NULL,0

1,487633,80,Russias war in Ukraine is changing the world See its ripple effects in all corners of the globe,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Earlier developments,NULL,0
1,487633,80,You can read past recaps here,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The chaos of the past week might be incorrectly comforting,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The referendums are illegal under international law and Ukraine the United States and the rest of NATO have already made it clear this move will have no legal standing and will lead to sanctions,NULL,0
1,487633,80,For months Western officials waved away any suggestions that nuclear conflict was even a consideration,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The principles of mutual assured destruction that brought a dark calm to the Cold War seems to have lapsed,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Putin is far weaker now,NULL,0
1,487633,80,This is a binary moment for Putin who has no climbdown or gentle offramp available,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Rusty rifles drunken busloads of recruits and still no answer to the key question of how these tens of thousands of untrained and perhaps unwilling soldiers will get supplied and equipped on the frontline if Moscow could not adequately outfit its regular army over the past six months?,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The chaos of mobilization already has Kremlin propaganda moguls like Margarita Simonian the head of statecontrolled network RT acting as a Twitter agony aunt for Russians whose fathers sons or husbands have been incorrectly sent to the frontline,NULL,0
1,487633,80,They argue overzealous local officials are to blame for conscription errors but beneath it all it is the war and its appalling prosecution that have led Russia here,NULL,0
1,487633,80,All of this leaves Putin far weaker than when he was just losing the war,NULL,0
1,487633,80,To add to his woes he now faces internal dissent that is perhaps unprecedented,NULL,0
1,487633,80,His position is dependent on strength and he lacks that now almost completely,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The forced mobilization of ageing men and unwilling youngsters is unlikely to change the battlefield calculus where Ukrainian morale is skyhigh and their equipment slowly improving,NULL,0
1,487633,80,They are all covered in the same blood of this war and behind the slow drumbeat of repression that has turned Russia into a dystopian autocracy over the past 22 years,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Putin has no obvious successor; do not expect anyone who finally replaces him to reverse tack and sue for peace and economic recovery,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Any successor may try to prove their mettle with an even more foolhardy exercise than the original invasion of Ukraine,NULL,0
1,487633,80,So we are left with a losing Putin who cannot afford to lose,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Without much conventional force left he could turn to other tools to reverse this disastrous position,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Strategic aircraft might carpet bomb parts of Ukraine though so many of its towns and cities look like this has already happened,NULL,0
1,487633,80,He might also turn to chemical or biological weapons although these would be too close to his own border for sanity or comfort and would elicit an intense international response,NULL,0
1,487633,80,But that too comes with risks for Putin beyond the likely NATO military retaliation,NULL,0
1,487633,80,A military that cannot fly enough of its planes or fuel enough of its tanks has problems,NULL,0
1,487633,80,It might worry that it will not be able to pull off an accurate limited and effective tactical nuclear strike,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Video Ad Feedback Putin is cornered ExCIA officer predicts Putins next move 0301  Source CNN,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Putin himself might worry that his fraying grip on power cannot hold together a chain of command solid enough to actually obey the order to launch a nuclear weapon,NULL,0
1,487633,80,This could even be the moment where the better angels of Russian nature come to the fore,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In the five years I lived there I met a bright warm and sparkling people blighted mostly by centuries of misrule,NULL,0
1,487633,80,This is a win or lose moment for Putin and he does not see a future in which he loses,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Hein Goemans grew up in Amsterdam in the nineteensixties and seventies surrounded by stories and memories of the Second World War,NULL,0
1,487633,80,When Goemans came to the United States to study international relations he recalled being asked in one class about his most formative personal experience of international relations,NULL,0
1,487633,80,He said that it was the Second World War,NULL,0
1,487633,80,But it was very personal for Goemans,NULL,0
1,487633,80,He recalled attending a commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the liberation of Amsterdam by Canadian forces in May of 1985,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Many of the Canadian soldiers who took part in the liberation were still alive and they recreated the arrival of Canadian troops to liberate the city,NULL,0
1,487633,80,A great deal of work Goemans learned had been done on how wars start but very little on how they might conclude,NULL,0
1,487633,80,There were perhaps historical reasons for this oversight the nuclear armament of the United States and the Soviet Union meant that a war between them could end human civilization; not just some dying but the death of everything,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The study of war during the Cold War thus gave rise to a rich vocabulary about deterrence direct deterrence extended deterrence deterrence by punishment deterrence by denial,NULL,0
1,487633,80,But the Cold War ended and wars kept happening,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Goemans saw an opportunity for an intellectual intervention,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Traditionally Goemans writes wars were thought to end because one side surrendered,NULL,0
1,487633,80,But the empirical record showed this to be at best an incomplete account,NULL,0
1,487633,80,But the Germans instead of accepting this kept advancing into Russia,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Only after the Bolsheviks agreed to even harsher terms than had been proposed just three weeks earlier did the Germans agree to their exit from the war,NULL,0
1,487633,80,More recent theoretical literature had acknowledged the twosidedness of war Goemans writes but here too important aspects had been missed,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The most common cause of the breakdown according to war theorists (and again borrowing from economics) was some form of informational asymmetry,NULL,0
1,487633,80,There were many reasons for this sort of informational asymmetry not least of which was that the warfighting capacity of individual nations was almost always a closely guarded secret,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In any case the best way to find out who was stronger was to actually start fighting,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Then things became clear quite quickly,NULL,0
1,487633,80,But there were other kinds of wars in which factors besides information predominated,NULL,0
1,487633,80,These factors in part because they did not play prominent roles in economics were less well understood,NULL,0
1,487633,80,If a country really wanted to break a deal there was no court of arbitration to which the other party could appeal,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Britain was losing the war and had no certainty that the United States would enter in time to save it,NULL,0
1,487633,80,But the British fought on because they knew that no deal with Nazi Germany could be trusted,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The other factor that had been ignored in the literature according to Goemans was domestic politics,NULL,0
1,487633,80,States were considered unitary actors with set interests but this left out the internal pressures placed on the government of a modern nationstate,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Goemans created a data set of every leader of every warfighting country between 1816 and 1995 and coded each according to a tripartite system,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Some leaders were democrats; some were dictators; and some were in between,NULL,0
1,487633,80,According to Goemans democrats tended to respond to the information delivered by the war and act accordingly; at the very worst if they lost the war but their country still existed they would get turned out of office and go on a book tour,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Dictators because they had total control of their domestic audience could also end wars when they needed to,NULL,0
1,487633,80,After the first Gulf War Saddam Hussein was such a leader; he simply killed anyone who criticized him,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The trouble Goemans found lay with the leaders who were neither democrats nor dictators because they were repressive they often met with bad ends but because they were not repressive enough they had to think about public opinion and whether it was turning on them,NULL,0
1,487633,80,I recently spoke to a number of wartermination theorists including Goemans to see what the theoretical perspective could tell us about the war in Ukraine,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The theorists turned out to be an engaged and lively group most of them glued to Twitter and Telegram in multiple languages as they tried to follow the war in real time,NULL,0
1,487633,80,They believed the wars that they had studied could shed light on the current conflict,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Apparently they were not the only ones who thought so,NULL,0
1,487633,80,intelligence agency,NULL,0
1,487633,80,There was very little cyber warfare and Russia had used just a few hypersonic missiles,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Tanisha Fazal a scholar at the University of Minnesota who is writing a book on battlefield medicine was struck by the low ratio of Russian wounded to killed,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The historical ratio in the last hundred and fifty years has been around three or four to one,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In recent wars such as in Afghanistan the US,NULL,0
1,487633,80,had managed to get the woundedtokilled ratio as high as ten to one meaning that fewer soldiers were dying after being wounded,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The Russians were estimated to be back down to four to one,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The reason Fazal said was that the Russians have not managed to establish air superiority; they cannot get their wounded soldiers out quickly enough and therefore many of them die,NULL,0
1,487633,80,More broadly the war had exhibited many traits that were familiar to theorists of war,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Russia claimed that it could not trust Ukraine to not become in essence a NATO state; Ukraine for its part had no reason to trust a Russian regime that had repeatedly broken promises and invaded it in February with no provocation,NULL,0
1,487633,80,But the resolution of the crediblecommitment problem was complicated,NULL,0
1,487633,80,But not many wars end with such absolute outcomes,NULL,0
1,487633,80,To add to the complications this war like others is dynamic,NULL,0
1,487633,80,A great deal has happened since Russia invaded Ukraine on the morning of February 24th,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The revelations of Russian weakness and Ukrainian strength have buoyed the Ukrainian public; the discovery of the massacres of civilians at Bucha and now Izyum have enraged it,NULL,0
1,487633,80,If once there was space in Ukrainian public opinion for concessions to Russia that space has now closed,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The Kremlin repeatedly attempts to delegitimize Ukraine as a nation and state in the eyes of the Ukrainian and Russian publics and international community,NULL,0

1,487633,80,Any claims by the Kremlin that Ukrainian people yearn to be annexed by Russia are simply not true,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Opinion polls show an overwhelming consensus among Ukrainians that they oppose Russian aggression,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In every Russiacontrolled region there are credible reports of occupation authorities withholding food water and medical aid from Ukrainian civilians until they have accepted Russian passports,NULL,0
1,487633,80,State propaganda outlets like Sputnik then depict lines of residents seeking Russian passports as voluntary with residents who offer conveniently proKremlin statements,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Yet polling data shows that in a free referendum Ukrainians in the occupied areas would not choose to join Russia,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Kremlin state media outlets falsely allege that Ukrainians in the Kharkiv region also seek Russian identities,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Kremlin disinformation outlets immediately amplified these false claims,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In a survey conducted by the International Republican Institute in April 2022 more than 90 percent of Ukrainians said their opinion of Russia has worsened since the February 24th invasion,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Russian officials recognize this reality despite their disinformation and propaganda efforts,NULL,0
1,487633,80,intelligence indicates that Russian officials are concerned about low voter turnout in these sham referenda and know their efforts to legitimize the illegal land grab will lack legitimacy and will not reflect the will of the people,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Ukraine Will Remain Sovereign and Independent,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Thirtyone years ago the people of Ukraine proclaimed their independence as a sovereign nation,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Since 2014 and particularly during the past six months the world has witnessed President Putin using both military force and deceptive statements to undermine Ukrainian sovereignty,NULL,0
1,487633,80,He has failed in that goal despite the suffering he has inflicted on Ukraine,NULL,0
1,487633,80,It will remain sovereign and independent,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Whats next for the war in Ukraine,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Nearly seven months of war in Ukraine Kyivs counteroffensive succeeded and Russia ordered more troops to mobilize,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Ukrainian lawmakers have been visiting Washington to petition for more arms,NULL,0
1,487633,80,After nearly seven months of war in Ukraine a lot has happened recently,NULL,0
1,487633,80,There was Ukraines successful counteroffensive in the east,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Then the Kremlin ordered more Russian troops to mobilize and its puppet authorities in Ukraine announced plans that would lead to further annexation of Russian occupied territory,NULL,0
1,487633,80,And if all that is not enough Russian President Vladimir Putin is threatening to deploy nuclear weapons,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Three members of Ukraines parliament recently met their US,NULL,0
1,487633,80,congressional counterparts and requested longerrange artillery and tanks,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Heres how one of those lawmakers put it through an interpreter,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In order to actually drive Russia out of our territory we do need more weapons,NULL,0
1,487633,80,There were three Ukrainian lawmakers here,NULL,0
1,487633,80,I spoke with one of them Roman Kostenko who is also by the way an Army colonel,NULL,0
1,487633,80,And again they want American tanks longerrange artillery,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Now Ukraine is getting tanks from Poland and a couple of dozen more will be provided by Slovenia,NULL,0
1,487633,80,All those are Sovietera tanks but the American tanks have greater firepower and are faster,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Thats why they want them,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Now with artillery theres a system called HIMARS provided by the US,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Sixteen of these highly accurate rocket artillery pieces are now in the fight,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Now the rounds the US,NULL,0
1,487633,80,HIMARS is only one of the items on that list,NULL,0
1,487633,80,And as we talked with the members of Congress we emphasized that in order to regain our territories that are now under Russian occupation we need more offensive types of weapons,NULL,0
1,487633,80,And so we were raising questions about such weapons as tanks aircraft armored vehicles  things we need in order to successfully continue the offensive,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Is the US going to keep providing more weapons? Will we provide this additional military aid?,NULL,0
1,487633,80,You know its uncertain,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Officials fear that providing the longerrange artillery could hit targets deep inside Russia and they dont want to further antagonize Vladimir Putin,NULL,0
1,487633,80,And a senior defense official said the US,NULL,0
1,487633,80,may provide tanks in the future but not for the immediate fight,NULL,0
1,487633,80,This official said the Ukrainians are familiar with the Sovietera tanks and would need further training on the American one both how to operate them and maintain them,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Now with Russian President Vladimir Putins call to bring up 300000 reservists that may spur even more talk of giving the Ukrainians these more powerful weapons,NULL,0
1,487633,80,And the people I talk with Mary Louise say its more likely youll see longer range artillery shells but not the tanks,NULL,0
1,487633,80,So well just have to see,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Jason what are you hearing about all this actually inside Ukraine  this need for more weaponry that the Ukrainians are putting out there?,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Yeah despite that recent haul of seized Russian weapons from the counteroffensive officials in Kyiv are saying that they really need these modern Western weapons and that they are highly effective  you know particularly as Tom mentioned the longerrange missiles and also equipment for air defense systems,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Theres sort of two prongs to this,NULL,0
1,487633,80,First they want these better weapons to try to really aggressively push forward with another counteroffensive in the south of the country at a time when Russia is clearly on its back foot,NULL,0
1,487633,80,You know this is sort of like Muhammad Ali would come charging out of his corner at this point from a tactical point of view and really try to push back the Russians from the territory that theyve taken here,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The second prong is defensive,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Ukrainian officials and you know even local people that I talked to  theyre very concerned that this could turn into a long drawnout conflict,NULL,0
1,487633,80,And if that happens they want to be able to protect their cities against Russian rocket attacks,NULL,0
1,487633,80,At the moment Russian cruise missiles can still strike anywhere in the country,NULL,0
1,487633,80,You know since the invasion all commercial air traffic in Ukraine has been shut down,NULL,0
1,487633,80,A better air defense system might allow them to get at least an airport out in Lviv in the west of the country open,NULL,0
1,487633,80,And you know youre hardly even seeing any military aircraft in the air here,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Ukrainians really would like some international help in regaining control of their airspace,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Before I let you both go Jason respond to something Tom just dropped into the conversation  that Russia may be possibly sending up to 300000 more troops,NULL,0
1,487633,80,How is that news being received in Ukraine?,NULL,0
1,487633,80,You know I have to say Ukrainians seem remarkably unfazed by Putins latest saberrattling,NULL,0
1,487633,80,People are saying that so far theyve dealt with everything Russias been throwing at them,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Its been tough but they say that theyre going to deal with whatever comes next,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Accuracy and availability may vary,NULL,0
1,487633,80,This pivotal moment could also force a tough decision for Western governments which have up until now offered support to Ukraine at a steadily increasing cost to their own economies and national stockpiles of weapons,NULL,0
1,487633,80,US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin is poised to lead a working group of nearly 50 countries to discuss the crisis on Wednesday when the US expects more announcements of weapons and equipment packages for Ukraine according to a senior US defense official,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Three potential outcomes,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Western officials are closely watching three possible scenarios that they believe could unfold,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Russia could continue to make incremental gains in two key eastern provinces,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Or the battle lines could harden into a stalemate that drags on for months or years leading to tremendous casualties on both sides and a slowrolling crisis that will continue to be a drain on the global economy,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Then there is what officials consider the least likely possibility Russia could redefine its war aims announce that it has achieved victory and attempt to engineer a close to the fighting,NULL,0
1,487633,80,For now that scenario appears to be little more than wishful thinking sources say,NULL,0
1,487633,80,If Russia is able to consolidate some of its gains in the east US officials increasingly fear that Russian President Vladimir Putin may eventually be able to use that territory as a staging ground to push further into Ukraine,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy issues a joint statement with European Commission President Ursula in Kyiv Ukraine June 11 2022,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Western officials broadly believe that Russia is in a more favorable position in the east based solely on mass,NULL,0
1,487633,80,As the front lines of the conflict have settled into a war of attrition built around backandforth artillery fire both sides have suffered tremendous casualties and now face potential manpower shortfalls,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Russia has also suffered losses of as much as a third of its ground force and US intelligence officials have said publicly that Russia will struggle to make any serious gains without a full mobilization a politically dangerous move that Putin has so far been unwilling to make,NULL,0
1,487633,80,For now the fighting is centered on two sister cities on opposite sides of the Seversky Donets River Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Ukrainian fighters are almost completely encircled at Sievierodonetsk,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Black smoke and dirt rise from the nearby city of Severodonetsk during battle between Russian and Ukrainian troops in the eastern Ukraine region of Donbas on June 9 2022,NULL,0
1,487633,80,A preference for Soviet systems,NULL,0
1,487633,80,US officials insist that Western arms are still flowing to the front lines of the fight,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Ukraine has begged not only for heavy artillery but also for even more basic supplies like ammunition,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Part of the problem sources say is that even as Ukraine is running out of old Soviet munitions that fit existing systems there have also been obstacles to transitioning its fighters to Western NATOcompliant systems,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In some cases according to one source familiar with US intelligence Ukraine is simply opting not to use the unfamiliar Western systems,NULL,0
1,487633,80,For example despite receiving hundreds of Switchblade drones some units prefer to use commercial drones rigged with explosives that are more userfriendly,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The Biden administration announced a new aid package earlier this month that included the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System or HiMARS which is capable of launching a barrage of rockets and missiles and which Ukraine had urgently requested for weeks,NULL,0
1,487633,80,But although a small group of Ukrainian soldiers began training on the system almost immediately after the package was announced it requires three weeks of training and has not yet entered the fight,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Meanwhile there are a limited number of Sovietera munitions still existing elsewhere in the world that can be sent to Ukraine,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Their performance under fire is an unknown quantity,NULL,0

1,487633,80,As the fighting has dragged on the cost to Western governments has continued to rise,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Then of course there is the sting of high energy prices and high inflation,NULL,0
1,487633,80,As those costs begin to impact ordinary citizens in the US and in Europe and as media attention begins to drift from the daytoday grind of the fighting some officials fear Western support for Ukraine may wane,NULL,0
1,487633,80,After a series of sham referendums in four Russianoccupied parts of Ukraine the results are out,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Unsurprisingly they show a resounding majority voted to join Russia,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The referendums are widely seen as rigged as many irregular voting practices have been reported,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Electoral officials went door to door with portable ballot boxes to collect votes from residents living in the occupied Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in the south and selfproclaimed proRussian republics in Donetsk and Luhansk with polling stations open only yesterday the last day of voting,NULL,0

1,487633,80,Below we zoom in on some of the ways the world has changed since the war began on Feb,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Ukraine and Russia are key exporters of wheat barley corn and cooking oil particularly for African and Middle Eastern countries,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Russia is also a major producer of fertilizer and petroleum,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Disruptions to the flow of these goods are compounding other supply chain and climate challenges driving up food and gas prices causing shortages and pushing millions of people into hunger,NULL,0
1,487633,80,More than 58 million people have fled Ukraine in one of the fastestgrowing refugee crises in recent history,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Humanitarian groups with resources already strained by crises elsewhere have sprung into action,NULL,0
1,487633,80,refugee agency has projected that some 83 million people might leave Ukraine and called for more financial support for refugees and host countries as both face challenges with access to food housing transportation education and money,NULL,0
1,487633,80,It has rattled prominent global players such as the European Union and the United Nations and forced countries to take sides in new ways that have led to escalating tensions and momentous diplomatic shifts,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Russia is the secondlargest producer of natural gas and the thirdlargest producer of oil,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The European Union has particularly depended on Russian energy; it is now preparing to phase in an oil embargo,NULL,0
1,487633,80,A historic restructuring is sweeping the global petroleum and gas trade as countries ban or cut Russian energy imports sanction Russian companies face Russias demands for payments in rubles and search for alternative sources,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Russia has more nuclear weapons than any other country in the world,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Its military attack on Ukraine has notably reenergized NATO a military and political alliance of the United States and European countries,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Urgently countries around the world have escalated military spending or have begun a consequential reevaluation of their defenses,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Parvaz Scott Neuman and Larry Kaplow contributed to this report,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Since February 24 2022 Russia has been waging a war of aggression in Ukraine and blatantly attacking civilians and civilian infrastructure,NULL,0
1,487633,80,This conflict initiated by an unprovoked Russian invasion has inflicted death and widespread suffering on Ukrainian civilians and military personnel,NULL,0
1,487633,80,More than 71 million Ukrainians have been displaced within their country and approximately 53 million have crossed borders to become refugees in other European countries,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In the 1990s the medical and scientific community began honing its capability for assessing and responding to armed conflict1 Recent wars and brutal conflicts have given rise to important discussions about the epidemiology of warrelated morbidity and mortality civilian suffering health care capacity in the midst of war consequences of abrupt population displacement and parameters of humanitarian response as well as legal and normative debates regarding the human rights and international legal dimensions of armed conflicts,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In Ukraine as in the early stages of other wars inadequate security inaccurate or incomplete reporting nonfunctioning data systems displacement of populations and indirect distant and delayed health effects have made it impossible to gather accurate morbidity and mortality data,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Through June 20 the United Nations had confirmed 4569 deaths and 5691 nonfatal injuries among Ukrainian civilians most caused by indiscriminate use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area including shells from heavy artillery missiles and bombs,NULL,0
1,487633,80,But the actual numbers of deaths and injuries are probably much higher,NULL,0
1,487633,80,For example according to CNN municipal officials in Mariupol believed that by May 25 at least 22000 city residents had been killed,NULL,0
1,487633,80,As in other recent wars the strategy of attacking health care facilities and health workers is now resulting in both immediate deaths and injuries and adverse consequences of reduced availability of health care2 Between February 24 and June 24 the World Health Organization reported 323 attacks on health care facilities in Ukraine leaving 76 people dead and 59 injured3,NULL,0
1,487633,80,A substantial proportion of civilian morbidity and mortality in Ukraine is undoubtedly attributable to diseases resulting from forced displacement and damage to food and water supply systems health care and public health facilities and other civilian infrastructure4 Communicable diseases are more easily transmitted because of crowded living conditions decreased access to safe water and food compromised sanitation and hygiene inadequate medical care and lapses in immunization campaigns,NULL,0
1,487633,80,During war civilians are at especially increased risk for diarrheal diseases such as cholera and respiratory disorders such as measles Covid19 and tuberculosis,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In addition antimicrobial resistance often increases during war,NULL,0
1,487633,80,As a deliberate war strategy Russian military forces have disrupted agriculture damaged food storage and distribution systems and restricted access to food,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Indirect consequences for nutrition may extend far beyond Ukraine; destruction of farmland and grainstorage facilities theft of grain and blockade of food exports will contribute to malnutrition in low and middleincome countries that depend on Ukrainian grain exports,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Rates of pregnancy complications maternal deaths premature and lowbirthweight infants and neonatal deaths will increase because of reduced access to maternal and infant care,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The incidence of some noncommunicable diseases will increase and preexisting cases will be exacerbated because of limited access to medical care and essential medicines,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Russian forces are also causing extensive environmental devastation,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Explosions and fires are contaminating ambient air with toxic gases and particulate matter and threatening the integrity of nuclear reactors,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Destruction of industrial facilities is contaminating water and soil with hazardous chemicals,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Russian military activities in the Black Sea are reportedly causing extensive pollution and disruption of sea life,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Deployment of antipersonnel land mines and cluster bombs and the presence of unexploded ordnance are presenting short and longterm health and safety threats,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The war has led to many documented violations of human rights and international humanitarian law that should be of grave concern to us all,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Russian forces have targeted health care facilities schools and civilian neighborhoods,NULL,0
1,487633,80,They have executed unarmed civilians,NULL,0
1,487633,80,They have raped women,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The Russian military has claimed to have deported to Russia 19 million Ukrainian civilians including 307000 children,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Russia has wreaked widespread damage on cities towns farmland forests and water sources which will plague Ukraine long after the war ends,NULL,0
1,487633,80,On February 28 the International Criminal Court (ICC) announced its jurisdiction over potential war crimes in Ukraine relying on recent requests from its government,NULL,0
1,487633,80,However the ICC in assuming jurisdiction over the international humanitarian law crime of aggressive war in 2018 stipulated that it apply only to signatory states to the Rome Statute,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Neither Russia nor Ukraine is a signatory state,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Prosecution for war crimes and restitution will be complex and probably take years to complete,NULL,0
1,487633,80,National and local government agencies in Ukraine and humanitarian assistance agencies of the United Nations and many countries have provided robust aid to civilians within Ukraine and in countries of refuge,NULL,0
1,487633,80,These efforts have included protection of civilians; direct provision of food water shelter medical care and other humanitarian assistance; and support to Ukrainian government agencies and nongovernmental organizations that are caring for displaced populations and those choosing or forced to remain in their homes,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Many civilians chose to remain in their homes which became increasingly unsafe as Russian forces captured and executed civilians and bombarded civilian neighborhoods,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In addition restricted access to food and safe water made it increasingly untenable for many Ukrainians to stay in place,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Yet it was often impossible to establish safe corridors for civilians wishing to leave as demonstrated by widely reported fatal attacks on civilians in transit such as the bombing of the Kramatorsk train station in which at least 50 people died,NULL,0
1,487633,80,It has become exceedingly difficult to protect civilians who remain in their communities especially in eastern and southeastern Ukraine where Russian military forces have implemented scorchedearth strategies mainly with the longrange missile and shelling attacks that have destroyed Mariupol and many other cities and towns,NULL,0
1,487633,80,These attacks have accelerated the killing of civilians and further damaged health care facilities and educational institutions,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Over the same period humanitarian assistance has greatly expanded and many countries are hosting Ukrainian refugees,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Nevertheless since late April the conflict has become a war of attrition as Russia attempts to wear down Ukraine by slow relentless depletion of its resources including manpower supply chains and weaponry5 This strategy now aims to inflict increasingly brutal losses with deployment of powerful weapons that kill indiscriminately often from great distances,NULL,0
1,487633,80,While nations and their peoples take essential action to isolate this dangerous state we also believe that health professionals have responsibilities not only to respond to the needs of current victims but also to engage in preventing the devastating longlasting intergenerational effects of war on human health and life,NULL,0

1,487633,80,The conflict is a major blow to the global economy that will hurt growth and raise prices,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Impacts will flow through three main channels,NULL,0
1,487633,80,One higher prices for commodities like food and energy will push up inflation further in turn eroding the value of incomes and weighing on demand,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Two neighboring economies in particular will grapple with disrupted trade supply chains and remittances as well as an historic surge in refugee flows,NULL,0
1,487633,80,And three reduced business confidence and higher investor uncertainty will weigh on asset prices tightening financial conditions and potentially spurring capital outflows from emerging markets,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Russia and Ukraine are major commodities producers and disruptions have caused global prices to soar especially for oil and natural gas,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Food costs have jumped with wheat for which Ukraine and Russia make up 30 percent of global exports reaching a record,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Beyond global spillovers countries with direct trade tourism and financial exposures will feel additional pressures,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Economies reliant on oil imports will see wider fiscal and trade deficits and more inflation pressure though some exporters such as those in the Middle East and Africa may benefit from higher prices,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Steeper price increases for food and fuel may spur a greater risk of unrest in some regions from SubSaharan Africa and Latin America to the Caucasus and Central Asia while food insecurity is likely to further increase in parts of Africa and the Middle East,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Gauging these reverberations is hard but we already see our growth forecasts as likely to be revised down next month when we will offer a fuller picture in our World Economic Outlook and regional assessments,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Longer term the war may fundamentally alter the global economic and geopolitical order should energy trade shift supply chains reconfigure payment networks fragment and countries rethink reserve currency holdings,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Increased geopolitical tension further raises risks of economic fragmentation especially for trade and technology,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The toll is already immense in Ukraine,NULL,0

1,487633,80,Energy is the main spillover channel for Europe as Russia is a critical source of natural gas imports,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Wider supplychain disruptions may also be consequential,NULL,0
1,487633,80,These effects will fuel inflation and slow the recovery from the pandemic,NULL,0

1,487633,80,Policies to contain inflation such as raising government subsidies could pressure already weak fiscal accounts,NULL,0
1,487633,80,In addition worsening external financing conditions may spur capital outflows and add to growth headwinds for countries with elevated debt levels and large financing needs,NULL,0

1,487633,80,Higher oil prices hurt Central American and Caribbean importers while exporters of oil copper iron ore corn wheat and metals can charge more for their products and mitigate the impact on growth,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Financial conditions remain relatively favorable but intensifying conflict may cause global financial distress that with tighter domestic monetary policy will weigh on growth,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The United States has few ties to Ukraine and Russia diluting direct effects but inflation was already at a fourdecade high before the war boosted commodity prices,NULL,0
1,487633,80,That means prices may keep rising as the Federal Reserve starts raising interest rates,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Asia and the Pacific,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Spillovers from Russia are likely limited given the lack of close economic ties but slower growth in Europe and the global economy will take a heavy toll on major exporters,NULL,0
1,487633,80,The biggest effects on current accounts will be in the petroleum importers of ASEAN economies India and frontier economies including some Pacific Islands,NULL,0
1,487633,80,This could be amplified by declining tourism for nations reliant on Russian visits,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Still commodity prices and weakening demand in big export markets add to challenges,NULL,0
1,487633,80,Spillovers are similar for Japan and Korea where new oil subsidies may ease impacts,NULL,0
1,487633,80,While some effects may not fully come into focus for many years there are already clear signs that the war and resulting jump in costs for essential commodities will make it harder for policymakers in some countries to strike the delicate balance between containing inflation and supporting the economic recovery from the pandemic,NULL,0
